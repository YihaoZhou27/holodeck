* **Hogg 1999**, [Hogg1999]_ - `Distance measures in cosmology <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999astro.ph..5116H>`_.
  * This is the go-to reference/cheat-sheet for basic cosmological calculations such as distances (comoving, luminosity), volume of the universe, lookback times, etc.

* **Phinney 2001**, [Phinney2001]_ - `A Practical Theorem on Gravitational Wave Backgrounds <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001astro.ph..8028P/abstract>`_
  * Pioneering analytic calculation of the GWB by integrating the GW emission of binaries over the history of the universe.

* **Sesana et al. 2008** [Sesana2008]_ - `The stochastic gravitational-wave background from massive black hole binary systems: implications for observations with Pulsar Timing Arrays <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.390..192S/abstract>`_.
  * Thorough description of how to calculate the GWB, with a discussion on some of the nuances.
  * Particular attention is given to the difference between the analytic formalism of [Phinney2001]_ and numerical / semi-analytic approaches, i.e. the effects of discreteness of binary sources which produces a turnover in the GWB spectrum at high frequencies.
